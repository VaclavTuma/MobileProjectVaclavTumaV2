# Mobile App with information about castles in the Czech republic

I have chosen this project, because I wanted to show, how some beautiful castles back home looks like.

Basic of this project is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ow3L39Wxmg and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGpT1pIJlw, other necessary tools during development were https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start#maps_activity_file and https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started

It is built with: Java - MainActivity, detailActivity and ItemAdapter | xml - activity_main, activity_detail and mu_listview_detail | colors - values -> colors.xml | strings - values -> strings.xml

How to run Application?
in Android Studio it is optimalized for Pixel 9 Pro, but the code should work from Android version 7. 

This app provides information about castles. By clicking on a castle, an image of it is displayed. The location of each castle is marked on a map, with the castle's name shown on each marker. There is also a button that opens the official Czech tourism webpage. You can switch between Dark and Light modes using a toggle, and the selected mode is reflected in the picture section as well.
